Instruction (Do not remove)
Remember to keep the code clean, efficient, modular and reusable. Ensure documentations are kept up to date, updating where applicable (README.md under docs; database-schema, RBAC_GUIDELINE, DESIGN_GUIDELINE under docs) instead of creating new documentation every time.

you can read "README.md" inside of docs, it contains the latest information on the codebase, RBAC_GUIDELINE and DESIGN_GUIDELINE before implementing.
