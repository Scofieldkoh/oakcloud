## Development Guidelines

This web app is in development and testing stage. All data are dummy, and it's acceptable to refactor and redesign without backward compatibility.

**Key Principles:**
- Keep code clean, efficient, modular, reusable, and consistent
- Update documentation under `docs/` instead of creating new files
- Follow [Design Guidelines](./guides/DESIGN_GUIDELINE.md) for UI work
- Log unrelated errors or improvements here
