# Task 7 — Billing tracking workspace

## Outcome

Implemented the billing tracking workspace for the Services administration area, including the responsive occurrence table/card view, filters, coverage reconciliation summary, lifecycle/reset dialogs, table preferences, and roster billing indicators. The UI uses manual tracking language throughout and does not imply invoice or payment-provider synchronization.

## TDD evidence

RED was established before implementation:

- The initial focused component run failed because the new `BillingWorkspace` module and its supporting UI did not yet exist.
- The reset-lifecycle test then failed with the missing `Reset tracked overrides` action before the reset flow was implemented.

GREEN verification:

- `npx.cmd vitest run --config .\\vitest.config.ts __tests__/components/billing-workspace.test.tsx __tests__/components/billing-coverage-panel.test.tsx __tests__/components/billing-occurrence-dialog.test.tsx __tests__/components/services-workspace.test.tsx __tests__/components/service-roster.test.tsx __tests__/components/service-roster-preferences.test.ts __tests__/services/service-roster.service.test.ts` — 7 files, 44 tests passed.
- `npx.cmd vitest run --config .\\vitest.config.ts __tests__/services/billing.service.test.ts __tests__/services/billing-coverage.test.ts __tests__/api/billing-occurrence-routes.test.ts __tests__/api/billing-coverage-routes.test.ts __tests__/hooks/use-billing-occurrences.test.ts __tests__/hooks/use-billing-coverage.test.ts` — 6 files, 67 tests passed.
- `npx.cmd vitest run --config .\\vitest.browser.config.ts __tests__/browser/services-billing.browser.test.tsx` — Chromium desktop/mobile flows, 2 tests passed.
- `npx.cmd tsc --noEmit` — passed.
- Scoped ESLint over all changed production files — passed with no warnings.
- `git diff --check` — passed.

## Visual/browser QA

Target flow: open `/services?tab=billing`, inspect the collapsed coverage summary, filter by status/company/family/date/timing, edit a billing occurrence, choose the value-change scope, and verify desktop table versus mobile cards plus roster billing indicators.

The in-app Browser skill was connected and used for the local-app attempt. The dev server stopped during instrumentation because the worktree had no `DATABASE_URL`; the exact navigation result was `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` after the startup error `DATABASE_URL environment variable is required` from `src/lib/prisma.ts:26`. Per the task brief, the explicitly permitted repository Vitest Browser workflow was used as the fallback. Its Chromium flow verified the desktop table, status filter interaction, mobile occurrence cards, and responsive billing content.

Reference fidelity decisions from approved gallery view 4/view 1:

- Kept the spacious 4px-grid shell and compact table density without tight margins.
- Coverage is collapsed by default; healthy coverage is a single compact summary and issue cards render only when issues exist.
- Desktop uses a horizontally scrollable/resizable table; mobile switches to occurrence cards.
- Included Open/Billed/Waived, timing/date, company/fee search, clickable family chips, pagination, and persisted `services.billing.table.v1` preferences.
- Roster indicators expose Covered, No billing required, Missing disposition, Missing start, and next-occurrence timing with a Billing link.
- Dialogs reset values on close, prompt This occurrence versus This and future for amount/currency changes, and support reset of expected-date/value overrides.

## Files

Added:

- `src/components/services/billing/billing-workspace.tsx`
- `src/components/services/billing/billing-table.tsx`
- `src/components/services/billing/billing-filters.tsx`
- `src/components/services/billing/billing-coverage-panel.tsx`
- `src/components/services/billing/billing-occurrence-dialog.tsx`
- Focused component and Chromium Browser tests under `__tests__/components/` and `__tests__/browser/`.

Updated:

- `src/components/services/services-workspace.tsx` to render the Billing tab.
- `src/lib/validations/services-preferences.ts` with billing table preference parsing/defaults.
- Service roster types/service/table for billing projection and indicators.

## Self-review and scope

The implementation stays within Task 7 and reuses the existing billing occurrence/coverage hooks and Oakcloud primitives. It does not add shadcn, invoice/payment-provider behavior, or database migrations. Full baseline tests/build/lint, live PostgreSQL coverage, and production-authenticated Browser testing were intentionally deferred per the task instructions; the missing local `DATABASE_URL` is the remaining environment-dependent QA limitation.
