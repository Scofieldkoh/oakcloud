# SDD ledger — plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-17-deadline-engine-and-services-workspace.md

## Execution context

- Worktree: `C:\Users\Scotfield\OneDrive\Documents\Python Project\oakcloud_development\oakcloud\.worktrees\services-administration`
- Branch: `codex/services-administration`
- Plan 2 base: `39eeb2a`
- Implementation agents: `gpt-5.6-luna`, reasoning `max`
- Per-task review agents: `gpt-5.6-sol`, reasoning `medium`
- Final whole-branch review: `gpt-5.6-sol`, reasoning `xhigh`
- Repository-wide baseline, full build/lint, and live migration gate remain deferred until all three implementation plans are complete, per the ruling recorded in the Plan 1 ledger. Focused RED/GREEN tests, TypeScript, scoped lint, browser checks, and task-specific migration verification remain required.

## Producer/consumer map

| Producer | Consumers / review consequence |
|---|---|
| Task 1 — persistence foundation | Tasks 4, 5, 7, and 11 must use the exact models, enums, relations, constraints, and indexes. |
| Task 2 — generic schedule/date contracts | Tasks 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, and Plan 3 must reuse the generic schedule contracts and Singapore date-only semantics. |
| Task 3 — applicability evaluator | Tasks 4, 6, 7, 8, and 13 must distinguish applicable, not-applicable, and missing-input results. |
| Task 4 — business calendars | Tasks 6 and 14 must use persisted calendar revisions and business-day adjustment behavior. |
| Task 5 — rule authoring/versioning | Tasks 6, 7, 8, and 14 must preserve immutable published versions and rule associations. |
| Task 6 — impact/publish/archive/queue | Tasks 7, 8, and 14 must respect impact confirmation and durable reconciliation enqueueing. |
| Task 7 — reconciliation | Tasks 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, and Plan 3 consume generated cycles/occurrences and settings. |
| Task 8 — client-service configuration | Tasks 13, 14, and Plan 3 consume generic schedule entries and per-client inputs. |
| Task 9 — roster API | Tasks 10, 15, and Plan 3 consume the accessible-company roster projection. |
| Task 10 — workspace shell | Tasks 12, 13, and Plan 3 extend its navigation and operational layout. |
| Task 11 — deadline APIs | Tasks 12, 13, and 15 consume deadline query and lifecycle contracts. |
| Task 12 — table/calendar views | Task 15 and Plan 3 extend the accepted operational views. |
| Task 13 — manual historical cycles | Task 15 verifies manual-origin behavior; manual cycles never create billing expectations. |
| Task 14 — administration UI | Task 15 and Plan 3 depend on rule/calendar administration behavior. |
| Task 15 — acceptance/isolation/performance/docs | Plan 2 phase gate and Plan 3 handoff. |

## Shared invariants

- Repeatable schedule entries are generic for every service family; there is no payroll-only schedule path.
- A schedule supports 0–31 entries with stable entry keys.
- Relative dates, including expressions such as the second-last working day, use persisted business calendars.
- Date-only computation is deterministic in `Asia/Singapore`; no UTC timestamp drift may alter a business date.
- Published rule versions are immutable. Reconfiguration changes only future/open, rule-generated, non-overridden occurrences; historical, completed, waived, cancelled, manual, and overridden records remain intact.
- Deadline types are independently filterable: `STATUTORY`, `CLIENT`, and `INTERNAL`.
- Deadline statuses are `OPEN`, `COMPLETED`, `WAIVED`, and `CANCELLED`; overdue/upcoming timing is derived.
- Accessible-company predicates must be enforced inside SQL queries, not only after retrieval.
- Administration mutations require administration authority; operational client-service writes require `company:update`.
- The generation horizon is 12 months unless the accepted contract explicitly narrows it.

## Accepted visual contract

- Cover the accepted roster, deadline table, deadline calendar, client-service configuration, rule administration, and business-calendar administration views.
- On the roster, family filters sit beside `Active`, `Paused`, and `Ended`.
- On deadline table/calendar views, family filters sit beside `Statutory`, `Client`, `Internal`, and `Open only`; do not render the wording `Filter families`.
- Service-family legends are clickable filters and preserve a non-colour text cue.
- Company events show the configured company display label and full company name where space permits; display-label fallback is the first letter of each word (for example, `Oaktree Accounting & Corporate Solution Pte. Ltd.` becomes `OACS`).
- Family colours configured in Service Administration affect both table and calendar views.
- Calendar defaults responsively to one or two months and persists the user's month-count preference.
- Maintain breathable spacing and at least 44px touch targets on mobile controls.
